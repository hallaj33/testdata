Predicting TNReady test scores.

This is my final project submission for MA5751 (Statistical Data Mining).

The dataset contains student data I collected from Dobyns Bennett. The names have been randomized in the CSV to protect student identities.

The goal of this project was to (A) Learn Python - this was my first attempt at using it - and (B) attempt to predict TNReady test scores based on various predictors (Teacher, Absences, Unit Test Scores throughout the year, etc).

Many of the models explored in this project suffered from overfitting.
